// You are writing react ha ?
// how to get input from user in ES6 ?
// I think we can use a package for that
// Which package na? readline
// const readline = require('readline')
// const input = readline()
// lets get familiar with es6 then we can look into UI and react
//okey na, I still didn't watched the full tutorial in ES6, ES6 apdiye teach na

// fundamentals is same in all languages
// you know the question and login write , just write the steps below , we can convert one by one into es6 code
// declare devices and status
// then get input from user
// check if the input is ON of OFF
// then show the result

//es6 la datatypes iruku but it will take dynamically , declaration ku there are 3 keywords - var, let , const

//for declaring the devices and status what can we use
// const readline=require('readline'); // do u know what this line is?declaring a constant named readline ,
// nop you are importing the package readline and saving it in constant // this is old javascript//here why are we importing and saving in constant
//previously there was no import in java so this was the way to use package//okey na
import readline from 'readline'; 
let input,i,choice; 
let devices=["fan","light"];
let status=["ON","OFF"];
choice=readline();
switch (choice){
	case '1':
		let func1=()=>{
			input=readline();
		  for (i=0;i<devices.length;i++)
		  {
		    if (devices[i]==input) {
		      console.log(status[i]);
		      break; 
		      }
		  }
		}
		func1();
		break;
  	case '2':
		let func2=()=>{
		  input=readline();
		  for (i=0;i<devices.length;i++)
		  {
		    if (devices[i]==input) {
		      console.log(devices[i]+":"+status[i]);
		      status[i++];
		      console.log(devices[i]+"is now switched "+status[i]);
		      break;
		      }
		  }
		}
		func2();
		break;
	default:
	console.log("either device not switched");

//https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array//just now i checked na
// check the above site to know about es6 arrays
// if you need any refernce just google it and choose developer.mozilla.org site, its good and nice//okey na

  // what you need to check actually ?wheather a device is in on or off state..
  // you will get on , off status based on index , how will you find the index ?s//we didn't set devices to ON or OFF states, we have to set the state of devices
  // what are you trying to display in output ?//state of the devices
  // which device ?the input device of user..//then next na
   // is this condition is right ?how to check if the index are same? why do you need to check for same index


//that's all na

//fine

//now we can develop the question
//now we get two or three inputs
// first input  --- 1 or 2 , 1 means device status & 2 means change device status
// if first input 1 --- get device name and display status (what we did before)
// if first input is 2 --- get device name and status, then change device status

// did you get the question ?got it na
// how will you proceed
//write two functions 1 and 2//1 will follow the above procedures and for 2 we have to write a new functions
// fine , change the aboe code itself

// did you know about break statement ?//yeah na
// can we use break in that for loop ?
//for changing the device status?
// we are doing for loop , if we have 1000 devices then it will check all the 1000 devices eventhough if we get the matching device before that
// can you understand what i am explaning ?yeah ok na i was thinking that for will automatically break if matching is obtained// it will not (in all lanuage)
//okey na // use break when we get a match i changed it
